# Contributing to Bugger

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bugger! This is an AI-only project with unique contribution guidelines.

## ü§ñ Core Principle: AI-only Project

**Every single character in this repository must be AI-generated.** This includes:
- All code
- All documentation
- All configuration files
- All PR titles, descriptions, and comments
- All commit messages
- All issue descriptions and responses

No manual typing. No exceptions.

## üìà Quality Improvement Mandate

Every contribution must make Bugger more useful:
- Better bug analysis
- Clearer insights
- Improved user experience
- Real problem solving

No changes for the sake of changes.

## üßπ Code Quality Standards

### Modular Architecture
- Maximum ~200 lines per file
- Single responsibility per module
- No duplicate code
- Clear, descriptive naming

### Current Architecture Example
- `config.py` - Configuration and environment variables
- `azure_client.py` - Azure DevOps API interactions
- `bug_analyzer.py` - Bug statistics calculations
- `bug_categorizer.py` - Actionable bug categorization
